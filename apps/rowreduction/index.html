                              href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzjpD-vff5o&t=93s&ab_channel=BrianVeitch">Video
                              Demostration</a> on how to use this app.</p>
                    
                    <p>Need to solve a system of equations by row reducing? Finished row reducing but you're not getting
                         the right answer? One of the major drawbacks to row reduction (Gauss Jordan Elimination) is you
                         have to keep track of a page full of tedious calculations AND choose the correct row
                         operations. When you first learn this technique it's hard to do both correctly.</p>

                    <p>
                         <Row reducing involves using three different elementary row operations. This app allows you to
                              work through (and choose) the row operations without having to do the actual calculations.
                              You get to focus solely on practicing and experimenting.</p> <p>This app guides you
                              through the row reducing process from start to finish. If you get stuck use the HINT
                              option. It may give you a suggestion on what to do next or simply tell you the next
                              operation. If you click HINT when your matrix is row reduced it will display the answer.
                    </p>
                    <p>Another benefit to this app is it will display all three types of solutions: unique, no solution,
                         or infinitely many. If the solution is infinitely many it will display the answer using
                         parameters.</p>
                    <p>What if you do all this handwritten work and still can't get the answer?
                         <p>You can also purchase the Instant Solution upgrade. Type in the system of equations and
                              click SOLUTION. It will generate all the correct row operations and matrices and display
                              them all at once. Now you can follow along and try to find your mistake.</p>

                         <h3>My first app!</h3>
                         <p>Row reduction was my second attempt but first fully produced iOS app. I learned the basics
                              of working with the storyboard, writing the controllers, creating segues through
                              the storyboard and programatically, and writing custom classes.

                    <div class="column">
                         <h3>What was hard</h3>
                         <p> After getting through the basics I found some other parts tricky. The first was how to send
                              data back
                              to a controller. A->B was easy but B->A took awhile to wrap my head around. Also it was
                              important to me that the app let you work with fractions. So I had to write a fraction
                              class. I learned how
                              to rewrite operators (+, -, *,) so I didn't have to write functions like add(Frac1, Frac2)
                              all the time.

                         <p>Not only was this my first app to the app store but it was my first app that included an in
                              app
                              purchase. I followed a lot of tutorials and used keychain to store the information. One
                              thing I liked was I
                              showed them an example of what the in app purchase would give you before purchasing.
