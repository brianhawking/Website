                    <p>Thanks for checking out my Row Reduction app. Check out <a
                              href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simplex-method/id1496635032">Simplex Method</a> at the
                         app
                         store now!</p>
                    <p>Check out a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aG4HxJUjwX4&t=158s">Video Demostration</a>
                         on how
                         to use this app.</p>


                    <h3>Features:</h3>

                    <p>- Solves Standard Max, Standard Min, and Non-Standard</p>

                    <p>- Let's you work through the method yourself</p>

                    <p>- Offers hints when requested</p>

                    <p>- Undo operations if you make a mistake</p>


                    <p>Need to solve a linear programming problem? Finished using the Simplex Method but you're not
                         getting
                         the right answer? One of the major drawbacks to the Simplex Method is you have to keep track of
                         a
                         page full of tedious calculations AND choose the correct row operations. When you first learn
                         this
                         technique it's hard to do both correctly.
                    </p>

                    <p>The Simplex Method involves using a sequence of "If/Thens" that lead you to the initial Simplex
                         Table.
                         This app walks you through the set up and creates the initial table. From there you can either
                         use
                         the method on your own or have it help you through Hints. Choose the operation and the app will
                         generate the new table for you. You get to focus solely on practicing and experimenting.
                    </p>

                    <p>What if you do all this handwritten work and still can't get the answer?</p>


                    <p>You can also purchase the Instant Solution upgrade. Type in the system of equations and click
                         SOLUTION. It will generate all the correct row operations and tables and display them all at
                         once.
                         Now you can follow along and try to find your mistake.
                    </p>

                         <h3>My second app!</h3>
                         <p>The simplex method app was a follow up to the <a href="../rowreduction/index.html">Row
                                   Reduction</a> app.
                              The structure and flow was identical so I was able to reuse a lot of my row reduction
                              code. I wrote that
                              app in such a way so I could reuse most of the code. That's what I learned... writing code
                              in such a way
                              that it can be used in other projects.

                         <h3>What was hard</h3>
                         <p>The difference between the <a href="../rowreduction/index">Row Reduction</a> app and the
                              Simplex Method app
                              was writing the code for the hints. The Simplex Method is hard enough to explain and even
                              more challenging to code.
                              I learned that writing out a thorough flowchart for the method helped me create the
                              classes, methods, etc. Basically
                              I learned that you should really plan ahead. </p>

                         <h3>What I could do better</h3>
                         <p>Now that I've learned more I would love to go back and redo this app. I want to clean up the
                              classes dealing with the simplex algorithm. The instant solution option prints out each
                              step
                              of the algorithm. I had to create subviews programatically. And I'm sure I can make it
                              cleaner
                              and more efficient. </p>
